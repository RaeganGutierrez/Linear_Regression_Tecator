# ML_Practice_Tecator
Practice comparing Linear Regression models in R using the Tecator dataset.

In this R file, I have created a few simple linear regression models using R's built in Tecator dataset. These models include linear regression, partial least squares, principle component regression, ridge regression, and elastic net. I then use R squared, root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean average error (MAE) to compare results.
